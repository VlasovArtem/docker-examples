Build your own image
1. Dockerfiles are part process workflow and part art
2. Take existing Node.js app and Dockerize it
3. Make Dockerfile. Build it. Test it. Push it. Remove it. Run it
4. Expect this to be iterative. Rarely do I get it right the first time.
5. Details in Dockerfile
6. Use the Alpine version of the official 'node' 6.x image
7. Expected rusult is web site at http://localhost
8. Tag and push to your Docker Hub account
9. Remove your image from local cache, run again from Hub
